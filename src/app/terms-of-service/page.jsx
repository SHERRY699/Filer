                  filer.me offers a Premium Privacy subscription service through
                  SnapMailbox. If you cancel this service, you will need to pay
                  a cancellation fee. This fee covers charges by the USPTO for

                  the service without paying the cancellation fee could lead to
                  SnapMailbox receiving official USPTO documentation regarding
                  your trademark without compensation.

                  Logo design services are offered on the Website. Once you make
                  the required payment and provide us with the specifications
                  for your logo, our designers create a unique, original logo in
                  accordance with your instructions and the package you
                  purchased. After completing the initial design(s) of your
                  logo, we will provide you with potential logos (the “Initial
                  Design Samples”). At this point, you may accept an Initial
                  Design Sample, request revisions, or request a refund. There
                  is no additional fee for revisions, provided the requested
                  revisions do not conflict with your original logo
                  specifications. The number of revisions you may request is
                  dependent upon the design package you purchased. Turnaround
                  time for a revision is 1-2 business days. After accepting a
                  design as your final logo, whether acceptance was made after
                  receiving the Initial Design Sample or after requesting
                  revisions, we will send you the completed logo (the “Final
                  Distribution”).

                  final logo. We only retain the right to use the final logo, or
                  any logo created in the process, within printed and online
                  portfolios, including promotional materials such as
                  newsletters and advertisements. You understand that after
                  receiving the logo via the Final Distribution, you will still
                  need to register the logo with the appropriate governmental
                  agency to gain full intellectual property rights to your logo.
                  An incomplete transaction results in filer.me retaining all
                  intellectual property rights of the designed logo.

                  hours of receipt of the Initial Design Samples and before you

                  will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to
                  hold an in-person hearing instead. The arbitrator may award

                  The filer.me strives to meet the trademark needs of our
                  customers in a professional, courteous, and efficient manner.
                  We want every customer to be 100% satisfied, so we will work
                  with any customer who has any questions or concerns about
                  their filings. Our customer service team is made up of
                  dedicated trademark representatives with one goal - to meet
                  each client’s needs in a friendly, caring, and efficient
                  manner. If you do not think we have met this goal, let us
                  know, and we will be happy to make every effort to resolve the
                  issues to your satisfaction. If we don’t, please request a
                  100% refund of the fees you paid to the filer.me. You can send
                  us an email at support@filer.me.com or call us toll-free at 1
                  (877) 721-4579

                <p className="text-secondary text-[13px] md:text-[15px]">
                  If we make an error in your filing, we will do our best to
                  admit it and make the changes needed to fix the correction as
                  soon as we can at no additional cost to you.
                </p>

                <p className="text-secondary text-[13px] md:text-[15px]">
                  Please note only filer.me fees are refundable; all government
                  fees involved in your filing services are non-refundable. The
                  USPTO may experience delays or deny your application without
                  any fault of the filer.me. These issues are out of our control
                  and will not be the basis for a refund.

                <p className="text-secondary text-[13px] md:text-[15px]">
                  If you decide that you want a refund, all such requests must
                  be submitted within 30 days of purchase. Your refund will be
                  issued in the same form that it was received. For example, if
                  the payment to filer.me, LLC was made by credit card, then the
                  refund will be issued to the same credit card used to make the
                  payment. However, if you choose, you may request to receive a
                  credit for future filer.me, LLC purchases/payments instead of
                  a refund. All orders will expire one year from order date if
                  we are not in active engagement with you at the one-year
                  anniversary from your date of purchase and you will lose any
                  rights to refunds or additional services at that time.
